Search Algorithms Maze Designer and Visualizer

-Application of Django, Javascript, HTML, and Python and skills like search algorithms and GUI

-Allowed users to design maze or use maze templates as well as allowing them to choose the starting point for the search algorithm and the target point. Search algorithm then would process the maze, outputting  a visualization of the algorithm searching the maze. 

-Algorithms include Breadth, Depth, Greedy, Uniform Cost and A* Search. Uniform Cost path cost heuristics including shortest path, path consistency and minimum walls touched.
